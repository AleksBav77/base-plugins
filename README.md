# base-plugins [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/base-plugins.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/base-plugins)

> Upgrade's plugin support in base-methods to allow plugins to be called any time after init.

**What does this do?**

This lib itself is a actually a plugin for base-methods. Natively, base methods supports plugins that registered with the `use` method and are only called once upon init.

By adding this plugin, plugins that return a function will be pushed onto a `plugins` array, and may be called later with the `run` method.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i base-plugins --save
```

## Usage

```js
var plugins = require('base-plugins');
var Base = require('base-methods');
var base = new Base();

// register `plugins` as a plugin
base.use(plugins);
```

Now, to run all registered plugins on a given object, do:

```js
var foo = {};
base.run(foo);
```

## API

### [.use](index.js#L42)

Define a plugin function to be called immediately upon init. The only parameter exposed to the plugin is the application instance.

Also, if a plugin returns a function, the function will be pushed
onto the `plugins` array, allowing the plugin to be called at a
later point, elsewhere in the application.

**Params**

* `fn` **{Function}**: plugin function to call
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the item instance for chaining.

**Example**

```js
// define a plugin
function foo(app) {
  // do stuff
}

// register plugins
var app = new Base()
  .use(foo)
  .use(bar)
  .use(baz)
```

### [.run](index.js#L63)

Run all plugins

**Params**

* `value` **{Object}**: Object to be modified by plugins.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the item instance for chaining.

**Example**

```js
var config = {};
app.run(config);
```
